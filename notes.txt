Get releases from specific repo

https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap/releases
 - tag_name - version number
 - created_at - when?

or perhaps use tags?
https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap/tags

There seems to be missing tags, meaning it doesnt go all the way back

Use forks/ stars to measure popularity or re-usability.

remove "todo/fixme" comments
